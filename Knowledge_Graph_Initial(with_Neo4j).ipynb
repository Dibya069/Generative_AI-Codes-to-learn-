It is one of the busiest railway stations in India, serving as a terminal for both long-distance and suburban trains with a total number of 18 platforms.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Victoria Terminus ===\\nThis famous landmark which has become a symbol of the city, was built as the headquarters of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway.\\nThe railway station was built to replace the Bori Bunder railway station, in the Bori Bunder area of Bombay, a prominent port and warehouse area known for its imports and exports. Since Bombay became a major port city at the time, a bigger station was built to meet its demands, and was named Victoria Terminus, after the then reigning Empress of India, Queen Victoria. The station was designed by Frederick William Stevens, a British engineer architect, attached to the Bombay office of the Indian colonial Public Works Department. Work began in 1878. He received ₹1,614,000 (US$19,000) as the payment for his services. Stevens earned the commission to construct the station after a masterpiece watercolour sketch by draughtsman Axel Haig. The design has been compared to George Gilbert Scott\\'s 1873 St Pancras railway station in London, also in an exuberant Italian Gothic style, but it is far closer to Scott\\'s second prize winning entry for Berlin\\'s parliament building, exhibited in London in 1875, which featured numerous towers and turrets, and a large central ribbed dome. The style of the station is also similar to other public buildings of the 1870s in Mumbai, such as the Elphinstone College but especially the buildings of Mumbai University, also designed by G Scott.\\nThe station took ten years to complete, the longest for any building of that era in Mumbai.\\n\\n\\n=== Missing statue ===\\n\\nDuring its construction, a marble statue of Queen Victoria was installed in the main façade of the building, in a canopy under the clock. In the 1950s, authorities had begun to remove statues of the British figures from government buildings and public spaces based on a directive from the Government of India. Most of the statues, including that of Queen Victoria, were sent to Victoria Gardens (later renamed Rani Baug) where they were left lying on the grass in the open until at least the 1980s. A Right to Information report was filed, but had no records of the missing statue being exported out of India. Historians now believe that the statue was smuggled out, sold by politicians, or destroyed. The symbol of Progress, another statue, featured on the top of the dome, is often mistaken for that of Queen Victoria.\\n\\n\\n=== Renaming ===\\n\\nThe station has been renamed several times. It was built to replace Bori Bunder, the terminus of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway from 1853 to 1888 and was named Victoria Terminus to commemorate the Golden Ju')"

He was born on February 19, 1630, in Shivneri Fort, Pune, Maharashtra. His father, Shahaji Bhonsle, was a Maratha general who served the Deccan Sultanates, and his mother was Jijabai.\\n\\nShivaji was known for his progressive and sensible administration. He built a strong naval presence across long coastlines, which was instrumental in countering the colonialists. He was also known for his innovative military tactics that included guerrilla warfare methods, known as 'ganimi kava'. \\n\\nShivaji established a competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative organizations. He also revived ancient Hindu political traditions and court conventions and promoted the usage of Marathi and Sanskrit, rather than Persian, in court and administration.\\n\\nShivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and time, but he began to be recognized as a great national hero during the Indian independence movement, as many Indian nationalists elevated him as a symbol of resistance and self-rule.\\n\\nShivaji was crowned as the king of the Maratha Kingdom in 1674. He was formally crowned as the Chhatrapati (Monarch) of his realm at Raigad on June 6, 1674. He died on April 3, 1680, at Raigad Fort, after suffering from a severe bout of dysentery.\""

He established a competent and progressive civil administration with well-structured administrative institutions. He revived ancient Hindu political traditions, court conventions and promoted the use of the Marathi and Sanskrit languages, replacing Persian at court and in administration.
